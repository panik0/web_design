            He is a Sanrio character and the title character of the Cinnamoroll universe.
         </h2>
        <h3>
            The most popolar Sanrio character since 2020
         </h3> 
        <h4>
            He is a small, shy and chubby dog with white fur, blue eyes, pink cheeks, 
            a plump and curly tail that resembles a cinnamon roll (hence his name), and long ears 
            that enable him to fly. Cinnamon is shy but friendly, and always willing to help out 
            his friends when they need it. He works at Caf√© Cinnamon, and sometimes sleeps on customers laps. 
            Cinnamon's favorite food is warm, fresh cinnamon rolls.
